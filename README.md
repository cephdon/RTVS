# R Tools for Visual Studio

THANK YOU for checking out this early version of R Tools for Visual Studio (RTVS). We've decided to make it available
early, so that we'll have more time to address your feedback. As such, there are bugs and missing features, so please
beware! This release is meant for evaluation purposes only, and not for production use.

### Installation

Do you already have **VS2015 with Update 1** and a **64-bit R interpreter** installed?

If you do, then [just install RTVS](https://aka.ms/rtvs-current)!

Otherwise, please see the [VS, RTVS and R Installation guide](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/installation.html).

### Documentation

The interim docs are available here:

* [RTVS Documentation](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/)

### Bugs and feature requests

Please file bugs and feature requests here on GitHub. Check if the same bug or feature request has already been
made by using search, and if so, then upvote it by
[adding a "thumbs up" reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments)
to it. Feel free to comment on any existing issues and feature requests with any additional feedback, clarifications,
or questions.

When filing a bug, you can also use the **R Tools | Send Feedback | Send Frown** feature to send us the product
logs to help us diagnose the problem better. This command will launch your email client with a prepopulated message,
and will gather the logs and highlight them in Windows Explorer, so that they can be conveniently attached to the
email. Please *do not* attach these logs to your GitHub issues, since attachments on issues are visible by everyone,
and the logs may contain private information.

If you need to reach the team directly, email us at rtvsuserfeedback@microsoft.com.

### Support and roadmap

RTVS is created and fully supported by Microsoft (and the community!). Currently, support is via GitHub and email
only, but we hope to add more channels soon.

We are planning approximately monthly releases (with both bug fixes and features) as we march toward 1.0 RTM later
this calendar year.

If you'd like to see what features are likely to go in each milestone, you can filter the bug/feature list by that
milestone. If you have a key bug or feature that should be attended to, please thumbs up / comment on it.

### Builds and pull requests

If you would like to build RTVS yourself, and maybe even make a pull request (highly appreciated!), please take
a look at the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

### Miscellaneous

If you use Python, also check out [Python Tools for Visual Studio](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS).

If you want to use RTVS with Azure Machine Learning (e.g. to read and write datasets), have a look at the
[AzureML R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AzureML/index.html).
